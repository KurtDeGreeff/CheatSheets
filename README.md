# CheatSheets
Cheat sheets for various projects I contribute to (PowerView, PowerUp, [Empire](https://github.com/PowerShellEmpire/Empire), and [PowerSploit](https://github.com/powershellmafia/powersploit/tree/dev)). Also a sheet for a commercial toolset we use frequently ([Beacon/Cobalt Strike](https://www.cobaltstrike.com/help-beacon)).

**Note**: PowerView and PowerUp have been integrated into the [PowerSploit](https://github.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit) repository. Their 'bleeding edge' versions will always be in the development branch. Empire also has additional documentation at [http://www.powershellempire.com/](http://www.powershellempire.com/).
